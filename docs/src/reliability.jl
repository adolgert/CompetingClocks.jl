# ## Overview
#
# The classic model for reliability is of a machine that is either
# working or broken. There is a distribution of failure times and a distribution
# of repair times [1]. Let's extend this idea to the reliability of a vehicle
# motor pool.
#
#  1. There are 16 vehicles.
#  2. Every morning, 10 vehicles go out for work. They all leave in the first 15 mins.
#  3. Each vehicle works at least half a day, at most the whole day.
#  4. While working, a vehicle can break, where the chance of breaking depends
#     on the total time since it was last repaired.
#  5. There is a distribution of repair times.
#
# Number two, above, says that vehicles start in the first 15 minutes. This
# plan will initiate ten transitions in rapid succession. We could,
# instead, start all ten vehicles at the same time, using a single transition.
# Either would work.
#
# CompetingClocks will take care of the timing of all of the events, but we will see that
# there is plenty of work to track the state of all of the vehicles. This
# extended example shows that, if we wanted to create more reliability models,
# it would make sense to create a framework for reliability modeling, one that
# uses CompetingClocks underneath.
#
# ## Define State for the Model
#
# If we think about an individual vehicle, the states are ready, working, or broken.
#
@enum IndividualState ready working broken

# There are four allowed tansitions among the three states because a vehicle
# breaks only while it's working.
#
const IndividualTransitions = Dict(
    :work => (ready, working),
    :done => (working, ready),
    :break => (working, broken),
    :repair => (broken, ready)
);
#
# An individual has state and parameters. In the language of generalized
# semi-Markov processes, this state is called the *physical state* in order
# to distinguish it from the state of each enabled transition for each
# vehicle.
#
mutable struct Individual
    ## State for the individual
    state::IndividualState
    work_age::Float64 ## How an individual remembers its total work leading to breaks.
    transition_start::Float64  ## This is bookkeeping.
    ## Parameters for the individual
    done_dist::LogUniform
    fail_dist::LogNormal
    repair_dist::Weibull
    Individual(work, fail, repair) = new(
        ready, 0.0, 0.0, work, fail, repair
        )
end
#
# The simulation as a whole is the state of the individuals and the system time.
# We put some parameters here:
#
#  * `workers_max` - Each morning, this many vehicles start driving, if at least
#    this many vehicles are ready, instead of broken.
#  * `start_time` - Vehicles start in the first 15 min or so, and this is that 15 min.
#
mutable struct Experiment
    time::Float64
    group::Vector{Individual}
    ## Each day the group tries to start `workers_max` workers.
    workers_max::Int64
    start_time::Float64
    rng::Xoshiro
    Experiment(group::Vector, crew_size::Int, rng) = new(0.0, group, crew_size, 0.01, rng)
end
#
# Make a simulation by making individuals.
#
function Experiment(individual_cnt::Int, crew_size::Int, rng)
    done_rate = LogUniform(.8, 0.99) # Gamma(9.0, 0.2)
    break_rate = LogNormal(1.5, 0.4)
    repair_rate = Weibull(1.0, 2.0)
    workers = [Individual(done_rate, break_rate, repair_rate) for _ in 1:individual_cnt]
    Experiment(workers, crew_size, rng)
end
#
# And make some helpers. The `key_type` says that we will track transitions using
# a tuple of (index of vehicle, symbol to identify the transition).
#
key_type(::Experiment) = Tuple{Int,Symbol};
worker_cnt(experiment::Experiment) = size(experiment.group, 1);
#
# ## Define Transitions for the Model
#
# If we were modeling one individual, transitions would be very simple,
# but by asking that ten vehicles work every morning, we require that those
# individuals interact.
#
# One way to think clearly about interactions is to think about the state
# of the whole system. If less than ten vehicles are currently working, then
# every ready vehicle must have an enabled transition to start work at the
# next available time. Once the tenth vehicle begins working, all of those
# transitions need to be disabled.
#
# It's implied that the start of each day happens at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc. When a
# vehicle becomes ready, or when the total working vehicles drops below
# ten, then each ready vehicle could work at a future time. This function
# takes in the current time and returns two times, relative to the current
# time, between which the vehicle can start work.
#
function next_work_time(now, fifteen_minutes)
    hour = now - floor(now)
    if hour < fifteen_minutes ## If vehicles are still going out today.
        return 0.0, fifteen_minutes - hour
    else ## You can't start until tomorrow.
        return one(hour) - hour, one(hour) + fifteen_minutes - hour
    end
end;
#
# Now we handle simulation events. This function's complexity is an argument
# for using a framework like a queueing model, a generalized stochastic Petri
# net, or some other continuous-time simulation framework.
#
# The arguments are:
# 
#  * `when` - The time of the next event.
#  * `(who, transition)` - This expands the `key_type`, which identifies the transition.
#  * `experiment` - It's our simulation data.
#  * `sampler` - This is a [CompetingClocks.SSA](@ref) from CompetingClocks to enable and disable transitions.
#
# The first few statements of the function are automatic for any transition.
# Then this handler works through the transition types.
function handle_event(when, (who, transition), experiment, sampler)

# a vehicle drives on a single day. You can see that these vehicles

# ## Run the Simulation
#
# Running a simulation means we are sampling from the stochastic process.
# For a continuous-time stochastic process like this, that means asking the
# sampler when the next transition is and which transition it is. If there
# are no possible transitions, the next time will be infinite and the chosen

#
# ## Observers
#
# Without care, data collection from continuous-time simulation can generate a lot of data quickly.
# In many cases, especially for performance analysis, not every event time and transition 
# is important. Therefore, to avoid saving the raw data stream, we use observers of the system to summarize that data.
# Construction of observers is important as it connects the simulation to tools or analyses
# that may be used to guide decision-making. It also identifies which variables and metrics
# are most important.
# 
# Let's look at a few examples for the vehicle crew.
#
# ### Continuous-time Summary Observer
#
# The first example will record data at every transition, but it will record
# only the total number of working or broken vehicles.
#
# This represents a single time point.

#
# This observer keeps a running sum of the number working and broken.
# Note that it has to know how different transitions change those numbers.
# The relationship between the transition and how it changes counts is called
# stochiometry (or stoichiometry), because it was first observed for chemical simulations.
# Both chemical simualtions and GSPN would have this information encoded in
# a formal model.
