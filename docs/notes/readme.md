# Documentation

I'm going to use GitHub markdown to organize notes and such that may become sources for software documentation or papers. There are:

  1. [delay.md](delay.md): talk about the various types of delays (any non-exponential clock) that comes up in modeling.
  2. [design.md](design.md): talk about how the design of CompetingClocks.jl implements the ideas from the [counting processes paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03939).
